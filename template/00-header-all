# This contains the spack-builder docker container recipe for %os%%tag%.
#
# This container can be built (from the top level directory of this repository) with:
#     docker build -t electronioncollider/spack-builder:%os%%tag% . --file %os%%tag%/Dockerfile
# This container is built automatically based on the main branch of the repository,
# and made available as docker://electronioncollider/spack-builder:%os%%tag%
#
# After building the container locally, you can also test it with singularity as follows:
#     singularity run docker-daemon://electronioncollider/spack-builder:%os%%tag% /bin/bash
#
